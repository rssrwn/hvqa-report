\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}


TODO discuss:

1. trade-offs (providing a env spec and requiring that everything be discrete) and advantages (learning the model of an envionment explicitly to allow explanations, error correction) of using hybrid models generally (as well our specific models).

2. Future work (adding NLP to the model, other types of questions that can be added to give further advantages of using hybrid, neural models (graph networks) for event detection, extending the ILP to be faster, more accurate and allow larger search spaces, multiple moving objects in videos, non-determinism in videos, etc).

3. How this model can be applied to related tasks (eg. VQA, captioning, maybe RL).
