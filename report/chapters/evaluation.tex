\label{chapter:evaluation}

TODO object tracker evaluation - perfect performance, if not remove ref from end of h-perl chapter (discuss that object tracker is not officially since there are no questions for it, but that unofficially it achieves perfect performance). Under actual object detector performance conditions as well.

Talk about timings, including trained relation component (or else remove ref from end of relations in trained model chapter).
