% TODO add this to property extractor discussion
% However, since the \textbf{object} rule in the grammar may contain a property value, knowledge of object properties may be required to work out which object a question is referring to, creating a `chicken-and-egg' problem. For example, if a question asked ``What colour was the upward-facing fish in frame 12?", and there three fish (with unique rotations) in frame 12, one would need knowledge of object properties in order to select a image of a fish to train with. A model would need to be capable of overcoming this problem if it is to make full use of the dataset.
