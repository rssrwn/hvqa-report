\section{Common Components}


\subsection{Object Detector}

Talk about how the object detector is implemented (since it is always common to all models)


\subsection{Property Extraction}

Talk about the property component (as a neural network), what its job is, how property extraction is done. Training will be discussed in the next chapter.


\subsection{Object Tracker}

Talk about the job of the tracker and how it is implemented (could give pseudocode algorithm for matching and tracking ids). Talk about Talk about uncertainty in matching and how error correction can be done from the tracker's point of view (again could give an algorithm).


\subsection{Event Detector}

\subsection{QA System}


\section{Hardcoded Model}


\section{Individually Trained Model}


\section{End-to-End Model}
