\chapter{Hardcoded Model}
\label{chapter:hardcoded}

Our first H-PERL implementation is the `hardcoded' model. The hardcoded model makes use of a mixture of manually engineered components and components which are trained on the full-data version of the OceanQA dataset. This model should not be taken as a solution to the VideoQA task, since it would be labourious and, in some cases, impossible to rewrite components for each new dataset envrionment. Instead we intend this model to be used as a benchmark for the OceanQA dataset, against which other VideoQA implementations can be evaluated.
